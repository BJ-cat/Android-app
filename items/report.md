# [G12 - Glow] Report

The following is a report template to help your team successfully provide all the details necessary for your report in a structured and organised manner. Please give a straightforward and concise report that best demonstrates your project. Note that a good report will give a better impression of your project to the reviewers.

Note that you should have removed ALL TEMPLATE/INSTRUCTION textes in your submission (like the current sentence), otherwise it hampers the professionality in your documentation.

*Here are some tips to write a good report:*

* `Bullet points` are allowed and strongly encouraged for this report. Try to summarise and list the highlights of your project (rather than give long paragraphs).*

* *Try to create `diagrams` for parts that could greatly benefit from it.*

* *Try to make your report `well structured`, which is easier for the reviewers to capture the necessary information.*

*We give instructions enclosed in square brackets [...] and examples for each sections to demonstrate what are expected for your project report. Note that they only provide part of the skeleton and your description should be more content-rich. Quick references about markdown by [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/)*

## Summary of Individual Contributions

Specific details of individual contribution of each member to the project.

Each team member is responsible for writing **their own subsection**.

A generic summary will not be acceptable and may result in a significant lose of marks.

*[Summarise the contributions made by each member to the project, e.g. code implementation, code design, UI design, report writing, etc.]*

*[Code Implementation. Which features did you implement? Which classes or methods was each member involved in? Provide an approximate proportion in pecentage of the contribution of each member to the whole code implementation, e.g. 30%.]*

*you should ALSO provide links to the specified classes and/or functions*
Note that the core criteria of contribution is based on `code contribution` (the technical developing of the App).

## Application Description

*[What is your application, what does it do? Include photos or diagrams if necessary]*

*Glow is a social media application specifically about mental health. 
Considering more stress people are undertaking in the fast-paced society nowadays,
it aims to create a platform to support people who are under negative emotions or seeking help. 
Users can sign up using their email address. 
After logging in, users can find a great deal of article and video resources related to mental health by searching. 
It also provides a map searching service to allow users to find in-person mental health support institutions nearby, 
if it has been given the path to read the location. 
Besides, in this app, users can communicate with each other by messages, 
edit their profiles and also follow those who they like.*

## Code Design and Decisions

This is an important section of your report and should include all technical decisions made. Well-written justifications will increase your marks for both the report as well as for the relevant parts (e.g., data structure). This includes, for example,

- Details about the parser (describe the formal grammar and language used)

- Decisions made (e.g., explain why you chose one or another data structure, why you used a specific data model, etc.)

- Details about the design patterns used (where in the code, justification of the choice, etc)

*Please give clear and concise descriptions for each subsections of this part. It would be better to list all the concrete items for each subsection and give no more than `5` concise, crucial reasons of your design.

<hr>

### Data Structures

*[What data structures did your team utilise? Where and why?]*

Here is a partial (short) example for the subsection `Data Structures`: ArrayList, RedBlackTree

*I used the following data structures in my project:*

1. *ArrayList*
   * * Objective: used for storing DataFiles for allow search feature and display feature.*
   * * Code Locations: defined in [Class MsgList](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7634090/gp-24s1/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/myapplication/MsgList.java?ref_type=heads)
   * * Code Locations: defined in [Class MessageActivity](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7634090/gp-24s1/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/myapplication/MessageActivity.java?ref_type=heads)
   * *Reasons:*
      * Dynamic Size:  we can easy to add or remove dates from the list without worrying about pre-defining the size of the array.
      * Flexible Data Types: ArrayLists can store elements of any data type  without the need for explicit type casting. This flexibility makes ArrayLists suitable for our date files including  integers, strings, custom objects.
      * Random Access: ArrayLists allow for efficient random access to elements. we can access it to finsh other operation, like search and display.
      

2. *RedBlackTree*
   * *Objective: used for traversing search content.*
   * *Code Locations: defined in [Class RedBlackTree, insert(),fixViolation(),leftRotate(),rightRotate(),listToRedBlackTree()](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7634090/gp-24s1/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/myapplication/RedBlackTree.java?ref_type=heads); processed using [Tokenizer.java](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7634090/gp-24s1/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/myapplication/Tokenizer.java?ref_type=heads) 
   * *Reasons:*
      * Fast Word Lookup: A Red-Black Tree provides fast word lookup with a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Thus, when user search something, that specific words can be quickly located in large text datasets without the need for linearly scanning the entire date.
      * Support for Quick Vocabulary Updates: When user change the searching words, a Red-Black Tree can swiftly update the vocabulary. This enables the real-time maintenance of the vocabulary during search traversal.



<hr>

### Design Patterns
*[What design patterns did your team utilise? Where and why?]*

1. *Singleton Pattern*
   * Objective: Use for ensuring that there is only one instance of a class throughout the application's lifecycle, preventing redundant creation and management of user data in multiple places.
   * Code Locations: defined in [Class LoginActivity, methods getInstance()](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7634090/gp-24s1/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/myapplication/LoginActivity.java?ref_type=heads)
   * Reasons: The reason for using the singleton pattern is to ensure that there is a single point of access to a particular class instance throughout the application. This is often useful in scenarios where having multiple instances of the class could lead to issues such as inconsistent state or excessive resource consumption.
    
2. *Observe Pattern*
    * Objective: Use for sending notifications to the user based on update messages received from the subject.
    * Code Locations: defined in [RemindObserver, sendNotification()](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7634090/gp-24s1/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/myapplication/RemindObserver.java?ref_type=heads)
    * Reasons: The method is used to create and send notifications to the user based on update messages received from the subject. This helps in providing timely alerts or reminders to the user, enhancing user engagement and experience within the application.

3. *Adapter Pattern*
    * Objective: Use for implementing a RecyclerView adapter in an Android application, to manage the data and views within a RecyclerView, facilitating the display of a scrollable list or grid of items.
    * Code Locations: defined in [ContentAdapter, onBindViewHolder()](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7634090/gp-24s1/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/myapplication/ContentAdapter.java?ref_type=heads)
    * Reasons: By using an adapter, you can bind data from a data source (such as a list or array) to UI elements in a RecyclerView without directly manipulating the UI elements. This allows users to jump to the message interface for better operations, or directly jump from the message interface to other sub-interfaces.
    

### Parser

### <u>Grammar(s)</u>
*[How do you design the grammar? What are the advantages of your designs?]*
* At start, parserType is meant to be a terminal. However, we found
people may want to add search content after filtering data type,
so we revise the grammar to make it available. In this case, 
it can work just as any other search engine to use any content as an input
with a possible "#article" or "#video" data type filter. 
* Advantage 1: Users can perform more complex and specific searches by combining content and data type filters. This makes the search engine more versatile and user-friendly, accommodating a wider range of search needs.
* Advantage 2: Allowing users to add search content after filtering by data type improves the overall user experience. Users can first narrow down their search by specifying the type of content they are interested in (e.g., #article or #video), and then refine their search with specific keywords or phrases.
* Advantage 3: This design aligns with how popular search engines and platforms handle searches (e.g., Google with advanced search operators). Users are likely already familiar with this approach, reducing the learning curve and making the system more intuitive to use.

*If there are several grammars, list them all under this section and what they relate to.*

Production Rules:

    <ParserContent> ::= <ParserContent> | <ParserType>

### <u>Tokenizers and Parsers</u>

*[Where do you use tokenisers and parsers? How are they built? What are the advantages of the designs?]*
* We use them for the search functions. Tokenizer can use a String as an input to output a red-black tree structure. 
Parser uses a tokenizer as search input and a list as input data
* In tokenizer, every time we call the method next(), the current token will point to the next token. 
In parser, method parseContent() is used to search related data containing the input in data's name and description. 
Method parseType() can filter data types and is used in search input and filter button.
* Advantage 1: The tokenizer and parser have distinct roles. The tokenizer processes the input string into a manageable structure, 
while the parser handles searching and filtering operations. This separation makes the system modular and easier to maintain.
* Advantage 2: Using a red-black tree structure in the tokenizer allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. This can significantly improve the performance of search operations.
* Advantage 3: The tokenizer and parser can be reused across different parts of the application, such as map searching, etc. 
* Advantage 4: The design allows for easy extension. For example, new methods can be added to the parser to support additional search and filter functionalities without altering the existing codebase significantly.

### Others

*[What other design decisions have you made which you feel are relevant? Feel free to separate these into their own subheadings.]*

<br>
<hr>

## Design Patterns
*[What features have you implemented? where, how, and why?]* <br>
*List all features you have completed in their separate categories with their featureId. THe features must be one of the basic/custom features, or an approved feature from Voice Four Feature.*

### Basic Features
1. [LogIn]. Description of the feature ... (easy)
   * Code: [Class LoginActivity, methods attemptLogin(), checkId()](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7634090/gp-24s1/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/myapplication/LoginActivity.java?ref_type=heads) and Class Y, ...
   * Description of feature: Users input their email and password to attempt to log in to the application. If successful, they are granted access to the main functionality of the app.
   * Description of your implementation: The attemptLogin() method manages user authentication by retrieving user input, attempting login, handling authentication results, and navigating to the main activity upon successful login. use checkId(NormalUser usr) to check and return the user ID from a CSV file based on the provided username.
     
2. [DataFiles]. Create a dataset with at least 2,500 valid data instances, each representing a meaningful
   piece of information in your app. The data should be represented and stored in a structured format
   taught in the course. (easy) 
   * Code to the Data File [mental_health_resources.json](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7634090/gp-24s1/-/blob/main/src/app/assets/mental_health_resources.json?ref_type=heads)
   * Link to the Firebase repo: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/my-glow-app-888/overview?hl=zh-cn

## Summary of Known Errors and Bugs

*[Where are the known errors and bugs? What consequences might they lead to?]*
*List all the known errors and bugs here. If we find bugs/errors that your team does not know of, it shows that your testing is not thorough.*

1. *Bug 1:*
   - App running sometimes stutter, occasionally flash back.

2. *Bug 2:*
   - In JsonReader Class, there is no handling or notification mechanism if the JSON file is malformed or the required keys are missing in the JSON objects. This might lead to situations where the app thinks data is loaded correctly when it is not.

3. *Bug 3:*
   - In LoginInActivity Class, the checkId method reads from a file which is I/O operation that potentially blocks the UI thread.

4. *Bug 4:*
    -In ContentFragment Class, When using context in a Fragment, passing getContext() to the ContentAdapter constructor can cause issues. If the Fragment is destroyed, getContext() might be null, leading to a NullPointerException. To avoid this, you can check if getContext() is null or use requireContext(), which will throw an exception if the context is null.

5. *Error 5:*
    -In MapsActivity Class, The API key is hardcoded in the code, which is not a secure practice.

6. *Bug 5:*
   -In MapsActivity Class, In network requests, such as those for obtaining directions, exception handling uses stack trace printing, which is not user-friendly.

7. *Bug 6:*
   -In MapsActivity Class, The onResponse method correctly uses runOnUiThread to update the UI, but processing JSON data and parsing routes are also performed on the UI thread, which can cause the UI to respond slowly.

8  *Error 2:*
   -In MessageActivity Class, In the loadDataStream method, if an exception occurs while creating or reading the BufferedReader, resources might not be properly closed.
