Conflict resolution protocol:
Any team member who feels they have a disagreement with others is enough to 
affect work efficiency or the team atmosphere. A vote within the group can be
held to determine the opinions of both parties, and the group will ultimately
adopt the opinion of the party with more votes. If one party still holds 
objections and affects work efficiency, his final score will be mark down.
